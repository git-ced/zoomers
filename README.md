# Web Client SDK

Zoom offers a web based HTML5 client that is used in environments where the end users cannot download zoom desktop clients due to internal IT restrictions or in very low bandwidth environments.

The web client lets end users join a meeting, receive screen share from other attendees, join the meeting through the phone and leave the meeting. Zoom has added a Web SDK as part of our developer platform to enable developers to embed this into their web apps. Key functions that are exposed include: init meeting config, join meeting, show/hide invite function, show/hide meeting header, get attendees list, call out, invite by phone, mute, unmute, mute all, unmute all, rename, expel, record, lock meeting, leave meeting, end meeting.

Supported Browsers: Google Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox with their latest version
